# Array linear Problems

**56 merge interval**

padding \(dummy\), pad the first element at the head to eliminate if/else for special case, in cost of subarray operation \(LinkedList good to use\)

```text
arr = [[-inf, -inf]] // so that arr[0] would not throw exception
```

**560 Subarray sum equals K**

Hash Map solution like two sum, but with one layer of redirection; did it so bad for the first time
