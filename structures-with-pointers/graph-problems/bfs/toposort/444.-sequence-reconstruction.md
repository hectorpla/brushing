# 444. Sequence Reconstruction

### take-away

1. the planning before coding: proving **necessary and sufficient conditions**
2. logic **isolation** : a. build graph \(bug\), b. topo sort

### **episode**

1. mis-interpreted the inputs: not edges, but **chains**
2. take care of the corner cases: len\(org\) == 1; nodes are not compatible in `org` and `seqs`

```python
def sequenceReconstruction(self, org, seqs):
    # if `seqs` contains more nodes than `org`, not possible
    
    # otherwise (vertexes are identical)
    # (1). having a chain connecting nodes in `org` in the graph 
    # is necessary for
    # (2). the sequence constructed is `org`
    
    # then
    # (3). the graph has only one topo ordering
    # implies (2)
    # otherwise, false
    
    # 0. build graph: bug <- assummed are seq are a pair
    graph = {} # int -> {int}
    indegree = {} # int -> int
    ## init the graph
    for seq in seqs:
        for node in seq:
            graph.setdefault(node, set())
            indegree.setdefault(node, 0)
    # bug: duplicate edge!!!
    for seq in seqs:
        for i in range(len(seq) - 1):
            src, dest = seq[i], seq[i+1]
            if dest not in graph[src]:  # avoid duplicate edge
                graph[src].add(dest)
                indegree[dest] += 1
        
    # phase 1: verify identical nodes
    if len(org) != len(graph):
        return False
    assert len(graph) == len(indegree)
    
    # phase 2: find a topo ordering of the graph and verify it is `org`
    ## BFS: peeling the onion (remove a node at a time that has 0 in-degree)
    q = deque(node for node in indegree if indegree[node] == 0)
    ordering = []
    while q:
        if len(q) != 1:  # exactly one item in the q, to form a chain
            return False
        node = q.popleft()
        ordering.append(node)
        for dest in graph[node]:
            indegree[dest] -= 1
            if indegree[dest] == 0:
                q.append(dest)
        del graph[node]
    # seems to unnecessary to check if the graph is empty (all nodes removed)
    return not graph and ordering == org
