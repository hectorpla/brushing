# 803. Bricks Falling When Hit

* Somehow know it is Union-find, struggling with coming up with a data structure that supports deletion, failed hardly
* thought about solved reversely but in wrong direction: flip 0 and 1

take away: corner cases

* hit the top bricks and the lower falls down
* hit a brick that has dropped
