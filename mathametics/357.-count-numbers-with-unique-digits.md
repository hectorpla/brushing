# 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

First attack the problem reversely: \# total - \# numbers with duplicates, but numbers starting with 0 \(padding, for number of length 3, 001 stands for 1\) are headache

> length 2 -&gt; length 3
>
> aa -&gt; \(xaa, axa, aax\)
>
> length 3 -&gt; length 4
>
> xaa -&gt; \(xaay, xayx...\)

analysis becomes very messy soon



Start over from the straight-forward approach: generate numbers with different digits

note: Pigeon hole theory

two cases: 1. starting with 1~9; 2. starting with 0 \(all the candidates of the previous length\)

> length 2 -&gt; length 3
>
> xy -&gt; 0xy
>
> normal part: 9 \* 9 \* 8
