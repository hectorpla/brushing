# 397. Integer Replacement



Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

1. If n is even, replace n with `n/2`.
2. If n is odd, you can replace n with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

BFS is a good cracking method to solve. search branches out when the number is odd. There is a **deterministic** way to determine which branch to take
