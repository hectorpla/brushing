# DFS reverse

Define heights \(count from leave to root\), there are two possible interpretation:

1. only consider the node's descendants \(366\)
2. consider the whole tree \(364\)

### 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree \(group by distance to the leaf\)

### 364. Nested List Weight Sum II \(did it bad\); 310. Minimum Height Trees: good comparison

group by height \(different than grouping distance to leaf\)
