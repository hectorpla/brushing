### 834. Sum of Distances in Tree



### 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

complex traversal case, prev- post- mix, 

tried to approach in a single recursive definition, still not a master of tree traversal !!!

turns out to be very error-prone

### 663. Equal Tree Partition

used the old fashion, very fragile; use the fact that the sub tree sum is half of the all
