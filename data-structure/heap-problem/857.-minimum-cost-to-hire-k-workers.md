# 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

actually pretty like 

idea:   
1. sort the workers by **wage / quality**, \(those whose are easier to satisfy come first\) 2. use a heap to maintain \(K-1\)-smallest quality, use the tail as the wage base \(w1\)

Firstly, start from the work who are hardest to satisfy \(first decide the base\), but need to know the smallest quality sum **afterwards**, the algo turns out to be O\(n^2\)

However, if do the other way around, we **accumulate** the quality sum, and try every possible **base**, it is O\(nlogn\) along the way

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
def mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage, K):
    # quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
    # q / w = 1/7, 2/5, 1/6
    
    # argmin (w1 + w2) ... = argmin (q1 * w1/q1 + q2 * w1/q1 + q3 * w1/q1 ...)
    
    # idea: 
    # 1. sort the workers by wage / quality, (those whose are easier to satisfy come first)
    # 2. use a heap to maintain (K-1)-smallest quality, use the tail as the wage base (w1)
    
    n = len(quality)
    workers = list(range(n))
    
    workers.sort(key=lambda w: wage[w] / quality[w])
    hq = []
    
    result = float('inf')
    qualitySum = 0
    for worker in workers:
        heappush(hq, -quality[worker])
        qualitySum += quality[worker]
        if len(hq) == K:
            # print(qualitySum, wage[worker], hq)
            result = min(result, qualitySum * wage[worker] / quality[worker])
            qualitySum += heappop(hq)
    return result
    
```
